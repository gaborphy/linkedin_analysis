# Linkedin analysis

Analysis just for fun published on LinkedIn platform

From time to time, I will bring new data from open source or from sraped web data to analyse, model and understand it. To achieve this goal I'm going to use the R software with RStudio and their extraordinary famous packages, like `tidyverse` and `tidymodels`. Of course I will publish the data as well as the source.
